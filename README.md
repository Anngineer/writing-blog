Deploy link: [Writing Blog Template](https://anngineer.github.io/writing-blog/).

This repository is a mock template for a blog page, using JavaScript to organize and sort posts via genre tags. Local storage saves the preferred light or dark theme for future viewing.

## Details

This project was built with React components in VSCode using HTML, SCSS/CSS, vanilla JavaScript, JSX, the Semantic UI React framework, and React Router Dom. Wireframes and mock-ups for the design were sketched using InVision Studio. The background images, blog images, and icons are licensed from Envato Elements and edited using Affinity Designer.
